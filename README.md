## Experiments with HabitRPG on iOS ##

This code is purely for messing around. Don't take it, or life, too seriously.

### Setup ###
This repo intentionally ignores a header file named `HERAuthData.h`. It is not included to prevent secret tokens from being stored in git. After cloning, you'll have to create it, and define two constants: `HABITRPG_USER_ID` and `HABITRPG_API_TOKEN`.

These are the user ID & API token provided in your HabitRPG account ([see here](http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/API_Options)).
